# Camera Sequencer

Camera Sequencer provides a shot list interface for Blender's native timeline. It allows you to easily rename markers, assign cameras to them, keep notes, and see the duration of shots.

Use the `◀️` and `▶️` buttons to **skip to shots** in the timeline. Click a shot's name to **jump to that shot**. `🔎` uses Blender's Preview Range to isolate the selected shot during playback.

`✖️` clears the entire shot list and deletes the associated cameras.
